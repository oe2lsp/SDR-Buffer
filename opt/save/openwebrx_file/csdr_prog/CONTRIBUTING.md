First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project!

Before I can accept your contributions, I need a signed copy of the Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA) from you, which is available <a href="ICLA.txt">here</a>.

The ICLA is needed because it will allow me to dual license the OpenWebRX project under AGPL and a commercial license.
I will also apply dual licensing to csdr, but only those parts that are original work (e.g. without the parts enabled by `-DUSE_IMA_ADPCM`; code taken from other projects is clearly separable).

However, even if there is commercial interest in the projects, I promise to keep them as open as possible, keeping my original intention to provide an open-source web-based SDR receiver software to the amateur radio operators and SDR enthusiasts.

This contributor agreement is based on the one of Apache Software Foundation, with some modifications.
When you contribute for the first time, I will send you the ICLA. Replying with only the information requested and the text "I Agree" is sufficient.

Thanks,

Andras, HA7ILM
